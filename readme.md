# Fast radial symmetry transform using OpenCV

This is an implementation of the Fast radial symmetry transform using OpenCV.

See details:
Loy, G., & Zelinsky, A. (2002). A fast radial symmetry transform for detecting points of interest. Computer Vision, ECCV 2002.

The code was ported from a MATLAB implementation and tested with OpenCV 3.0.0 (x64).
